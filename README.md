# Multi-Platform Business Directory Scraper & Local Citation Audit Engine

> A scalable, enterprise-grade NestJS service that performs **real-time local citation audits** across multiple business directories, search engines, and social platforms. The system is inspired by core Yext functionality, enabling automated NAP (Name, Address, Phone) verification, consistency auditing, and database synchronization.

---

## Overview

This project scrapes business listings from multiple online directories, validates the consistency of business information against user-provided data, and stores audit results for future analysis.

The engine is designed with scalability, fault tolerance, and concurrency control in mind, making it suitable for processing large batches of business citation audits while minimizing resource consumption and avoiding rate limits.

# Workflow

1. Receive business details.
2. Create scraping tasks for enabled platforms.
3. Execute tasks using a configurable worker pool.
4. Collect scraped business information.
5. Compare scraped data with expected NAP values.
6. Generate audit results.
7. Update or insert records into the database.
8. Return structured audit results.
9. Optionally stream each completed result.

---

# Concurrency Control

Instead of executing every scraper using `Promise.all()`, the service processes tasks through a configurable worker pool.

```typescript
const CONCURRENCY_LIMIT = 3;

let currentIndex = 0;

const worker = async () => {
  while (currentIndex < taskFactories.length) {
    const index = currentIndex++;
    const task = taskFactories[index];
    await task();
  }
};

const workers = Array.from(
  { length: CONCURRENCY_LIMIT },
  () => worker()
);

await Promise.all(workers);
```

### Benefits

- Prevents excessive memory usage
- Avoids request bursts
- Minimizes IP bans
- Better CPU utilization
- Scales efficiently

---

# NAP Verification Engine

The audit engine validates three primary business attributes.

## 1. Name Matching

- Direct substring comparison
- Token overlap comparison
- Minimum **40% token match**

---

## 2. Address Matching

- Substring comparison
- Token overlap analysis
- Minimum **40% token match**

---

## 3. Phone Matching

Phone numbers are normalized before comparison.

Example:

```
+1 (555) 123-4567
```

↓

```
5551234567
```

Comparison is then performed using strict equality.

---

# Verification Rules

A listing is considered **Verified** if **at least two of the following match**:

- Name
- Address
- Phone

Otherwise it is marked as **Mismatch**.

---

# Confidence Score

```
Score = round((Matched Criteria / 3) × 100)
```

| Matched Fields | Match Count | Status | Score |
|---------------|------------|--------|------|
| None | 0 | Mismatch | 0% |
| Any 1 | 1 | Mismatch | 33% |
| Any 2 | 2 | Verified | 67% |
| All 3 | 3 | Verified | 100% |

---

# Database Synchronization

The project uses **TypeORM** to maintain citation records.

## Stored Entity

```typescript
{
  name,
  address,
  phone,
  locationLink,
  source,
  status
}
```

## Synchronization Logic

For every scraped result:

- Search using `locationLink`
- Insert new record if none exists
- Update existing record when data changes
- Skip update if no changes are detected

If database synchronization fails, the scraper still returns the collected data without interrupting the audit process.

---
